This 5-stage pipelined processor was developed as part of our BTech Major Project at Shiv Nadar Institution of Eminence, under the guidance of Dr. Venkatnarayan Hariharan.

We undertook this project with the goal of deepening our understanding of processor design and computer architecture, and were able to achieve so with the help of the book Basic Computer Architecture authored by Prof. Smruti Sarangi. The processor implements the SimpleRisc ISA, from the book ”Basic Computer Architecture” featuring five pipeline stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Operand Fetch (OF), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MA), and Write Back (WB).  

The processor includes essential modules such as a control unit, memory unit, ALU, and register file, all integrated within the top-level module.
